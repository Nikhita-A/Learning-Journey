### What is a reverse proxy?

[Refer here for detailed explanation](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/)

### Stateful and Stateless Applications

* Stateful Applications use local storage for storing some state information
* Stateless Applications donot use local storage they rather rely on external systems to store state.
* As a recommended practice, all the state should be stored in external storages (database, shared files etc)
* Stateful applications remember the state of a client connection to the application like shopping websites, they may track user credentials, browsing history, shopping cart, session history etc. 
* Stateless applications don't track anything like if you browse any random news site or search engine as long as you're not logged in. If you login, then there'll be state tracking.
