VIRTUALIZATION
--------------

* Virtualization is a process that allows computer to share its hardware resources with multiple digitally separated environments.
* Each virtualized environment runs within its allocated resources such as memory, CPU and storage.
* Virtual machines and hypervisors are two important concepts in virtualization.
* It is a concept where the problem of wasting resources on a server is solved

Cloud
------


* A cloud is a distributed collection of servers that host software and infrastructure, and it is accessed over the internet
* Whatever a cloud provides is a `service` and whatever a user creates is a `resource`


### Types of Cloud

### Public Cloud

* _Public Cloud_ is a type of cloud computing in which the resources or services are offered by the third-party cloud service providers(CSP) via internet and shared by organizations and individuals who want to use or purchase them
*  Public cloud services are typically offered on a `pay-as-you-go` or subscription basis


### Private Cloud

* A _Private Cloud_ refers to a cloud computing environment that is exclusively used by a single organization i.e. it is within the boundaries of an organization
* In a private cloud, the providers and the users are the same and the infrastructure and hardware are owned and used  by the organization itself
* A private cloud is dedicated to a specific business or entity. 
* Private clouds can be hosted on-premises, within an organization's data center, or they can be provided and managed by a third-party service provider.
* Examples of private clouds are â€“ Amazon VPC, HPE, VMware, OpenStack and IBM.

### Hybrid Cloud

* _Hybrid Cloud_ is basically a combination of public and private clouds
* It is a mixed computing environment where the applications are run using the combination of computing services in different environments i.e. on-premises datacenter and third party public clouds

### Community Cloud

* _Community Cloud_ is like a custom cloud for special purposes(Government projects etc...)
* It refers to a shared cloud computing service environment that is targeted to a limited set of organizations or employees (such as banks or heads of trading firms).

### Multi Cloud

* When an organization uses different clouds like AWS, Azure, GCP etc for different purposes based on their requirements, it is called a _multi cloud_ scenario
