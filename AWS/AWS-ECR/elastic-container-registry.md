Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
--------------------------------

[Refer here for detailed notes](https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/aws-devops-zero-to-hero/tree/main/day-20)

* ECR is a service in AWS to store and manage `docker images`
* `Elastic`: highly scalable and available in nature

### ECR vs DockerHub

* When we create a repository in DockerHub, by default it would be _public repository_.
* Whereas, when we create a repository in ECR, by default it would be _private repository_.
* We can integrate IAM users with ECR
* ECR has better integration will other AWS resources when compared to DockerHub
